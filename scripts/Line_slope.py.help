Values less than 4 can produce serious errors in slope calculation, and values close to 10 lower the slope value accuracy for each segment, but have the advantage of increasing the speed of calculation.", "ALG_DESC": "This script is intended to calculate slopes of line layers, representing road networks, based on a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in the form of a one band raster (or grid), with altitude values. The size of the cells should not exceed 50 meters, and a raster of 10 to 25 meters cell size is recommended.\nThe script does not change the original line layer, producing a new layer, called \"Intersection\", the latter being a line layer with all the fields of the original, plus a new field called \"Slope\", with the values of the slope in percentage (%).\nIt is advised that the line layer, DTM, and project are in the same projected coordinate system.", "DTM": "Digital Terrain Model (DTM) or DEM.
